### 🛠️ The Project Brief
I created this demo to show how a local business in the Dundee & Tayside area can establish a premium digital presence. The focus was on building trust through clean design, intuitive navigation, and clear calls-to-action.

### ✨ Key Features
* **Properly Responsive:** Built with a mobile-first approach to ensure it looks sharp on any device.
* **UX/UI Design:** Focused on hierarchy and readability to help users find information quickly.
* **Clean Implementation:** Semantic HTML and modern CSS (Flexbox/Grid) for a lightweight, accessible site.
* **Localised Branding:** Tailored for the Dundee market to demonstrate an understanding of regional business identity.

### 🏗️ Built With
* **Design:** Bespoke UI layout (Figma)
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript
* **Hosting:** I use GitHub Pages to host live, interactive previews of my work (like the one below) so you can see my code in action.

### 💼 About Me
I am a **Web Design & Development Graduate** based in Dundee. While I am currently taking on **freelance projects**, I am actively seeking a **permanent role** where I can contribute my design and frontend skills to a forward-thinking team.

I’m a designer who actually enjoys getting stuck into the code—ensuring the final product is as functional as it is aesthetic.
